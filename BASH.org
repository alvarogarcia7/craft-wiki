*** Validate format without executing the script


The string "-n" has two primary uses in Bash, depending on the context in which it appears: as a command-line option for the bash executable itself or as a conditional expression operator within a script or an if statement. 
1. As a Bash Command-Line Option (bash -n script.sh) 
When used as an option when invoking the bash shell, -n stands for "no execute". 
Function: It instructs Bash to read commands but not execute them.
Purpose: This is primarily used to check a shell script for syntax errors without actually running the script and potentially causing any unintended side effects. 
Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC
bash -n your_script.sh
#+END_SRC
