**** ? / Result<>
- Interesting pattern for cumulating results into a Result<X, _>, where X is your desired type and _ is the error. The `anyhow` crate is also interesting
#+BEGIN_SRC
let options = SkimOptionsBuilder::default()
  .multi(false)
  .prompt(Some(prompt))
  .build()
  .map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!("Failed to build skim options: {}", e))?;
#+END_SRC

**** When VsCode does not recognize tests

- To launch and run Rust tests in VS Code, you primarily use the rust-analyzer extension, which provides in-editor controls and integrates with the Test Explorer. 

- Install Rust: Ensure Rust is installed on your system.
- Install rust-analyzer extension: In VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or the extensions icon in the Activity Bar), search for "rust-analyzer", and install it.
- Enable Test Explorer (if needed): By default, the Test Explorer should be enabled, but if you don't see tests, check your VS Code settings for rust-analyzer.testExplorer and ensure it is ticked. 

- then find a file, run the tests. They will appear on the "Testing" tab (the lab container icon)
